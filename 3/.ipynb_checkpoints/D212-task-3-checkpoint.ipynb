    "    Market basket analysis analyzes the selected data set by identifying item sets that are frequently purchased. Association rules are generated based on the frequency of item sets. Once the association rules are generated they can be evaluated using metrics such as confidence, lift, and support. An expected outcome would be for the analysis to identify all frequently purchased item sets and the relationship or association rules between the items. Each association rule will have a metric such as confidence, lift, and support applied to it. Finally, the metrics can be evaluated and decisions made concerning product placement, promotions and others.\n",

This analysis can drive business decisions such as product placement, marketing, and promotion design. Since we know that VIVO Dual LCD Monitor Desk mount and Dust-Off Compressed Gas 2 pack have a support of .05975, stores can place these items together, or feature advertisements for the two products on  the same page of the newspaper. This is a good decision because we know the probability of a customer buying the Dust-Off if the customer buys the LCD monitor. That is one practically significant finding of the analysis.\n",

    "    A recommended course of action based on the the results of D1 is that businesses should feature product placement of VIVO Dual LCD Monitor Desk mount and Dust-Off Compressed Gas 2 pack near each other because of the support metric. The data shows that there is a higher probability of selling Dust-Off to a customer that is buying a LCD monitor. Inside the store Dust-Off should be placed next to the HP ink because of the lift metric. This is because customers have a 1.3488 higher likelihood of purchasing Dust-Off when purchasing HP ink compared to those customers who do not buy HP ink. These are a couple of actionable strategies based on the results of the analysis."
